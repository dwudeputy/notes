## How to run unit tests at `vnext` deputy-webapp project

```bash
# RUN for specific (eg: Module) folder
npm run test:unit -- --testPathPattern="modules/integrations"
# RUN a specific unit test based on path pattern
npm run test:unit -- --testPathPattern="bank-details-conditional-value.spec.ts"
# RUN a specific unit test (single file)
pnpm test:unit src/tests/lib/feature-gating.spec.ts --run

## `Preferences` APIs:

This is the API endpoints which uses for saving some values into local stroage, it has prefix value: `API_PREF`

```bash
# For Prodtest Environment:
https://coconuttestchangeurl.au.deputy.com/api/management/v2/employee/279/preferences
# For Local Environment:
https://business.dev.local.dpty.io/api/management/v2/employee/1/preferences
```

Also in browser, we could use this command to trigger API request and then manual control the preference values inside localstorage, by typing:

```bash
# { syncBackend: true }: means it will sync with backend
# Pleas ensure the variable name must be WITHOUT API_PREF prefix, just the variable name ONLY ~
window.globalLibs.PreferencesV2Service.updatePreference('VARIABLE_NAME_WITHOUT_API_PREF_PREFIX', value, { syncBackend: true })
# window.globalLibs.PreferencesV2Service.updatePreference('KudosWelcomeBannerHidden', false, { syncBackend: true })
```
